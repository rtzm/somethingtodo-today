## Local development

1. `docker compose up -d` - run the database
1. `symfony server:start` - start the server

Some starter prompts:
Make an open faced sandwich
Pinch your cheek with your thumb inside your mouth
clean out your belly button lint
Hum two bars of Yankee Doodle Dandy into your sock
Drink water with a spoon
write yourself a nice note in lipstick on the mirror
make yourself a peanut butter banana concoction
Imagine a freight train plowing through a marshmallow barrier
